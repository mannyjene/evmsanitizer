> **The fastest way to sell multiple tokens across EVM chains.**

> 🚨 **Important**: The original project URL is [https://dustoff.fun](https://dustoff.fun). This is a fork/clone of that project.

**EVMSanitizer** is a lightweight Next.js-based dApp designed to streamline multi-token sales across EVM-compatible chains. It supports up to six tokens in one transaction, filters burn-only assets, and routes transactions using ODOS and The Graph, with token data fetched via Blockscout APIs.

# Wallet Connect / AppKit Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id

# Supported Chains (comma-separated chain IDs, e.g., "1,8453,42161")
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAINS=1,8453,42161,10,137,534352,5000,59144,324,1101,250

# Use mock data for development (true/false)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=false

# API Keys (optional - some features may have limited functionality without them)
BLOCKSCOUT_API_KEY=your_blockscout_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_THEGRAPH_API_KEY=your_thegraph_api_key

# Partner/Partner Configuration (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTNER_CODE=0

# Support/Feedback Link (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_LINK=https://t.me/+0j9GpMQpGsU5MWQy
